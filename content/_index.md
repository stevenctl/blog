This blog is not intended to be some super polished thing.
I bought the domain [landow.dev](https://landow.dev) a while back and needed to put it to use.

The goal is to write things down as I learn them. The format might seem like I'm trying to be
instructional. Take it all with a grain of salt. If I bothered to write something on this blog,
it's guaranteed that I'm not an expert on it.

Although I'm writing over a year later I'm backdating the posts in this blog.
My goal is to fill the first few posts with snapshots of what I have slowly worked on
for the past few years. The project/projects only received a few hours of work each week.
Sometimes there were very long breaks where I didn't play with it for over a month.

Hopefully the first few posts will be enough to "catch up" to what I am doing now.
