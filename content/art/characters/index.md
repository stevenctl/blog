These are a few of the first things I ever made in Blender. It turns out
characters are way harder than hard surface.

###  Legfish

Literally the first completed model I ever made in Blender. For this, I used a [Skin
Modifier](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/skin.html)
and [Subdivision
Surface](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface.html)
based workflow. Joey Carlino has some great
[tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAAwy_l4jw4&t=2s) for this on
YouTube. A nice starting point, but a bit finnicky.

### Cat Knight

I read the first few chapters of [The Animator's Survival
Kit](http://www.theanimatorssurvivalkit.com/) because Mixamo animations look
pretty bad on stylized characters, and winging it produced wasn't working
either. I'm never going to be a professional animator, but it's nice to be able
to throw things together for my own use. So this is my first run cycle.

### Gobgob

Because I already had a stylized biped base rigged, I reused that, modeled a new
head, and stitched that on. After extruding the ears, I learned a bit about
rerouting edge/face flow. I like him a lot.
