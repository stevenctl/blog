I don't consider myself much of an artist. To learn 3D, I could either download other people's
assets or make my own. It turns out you get a much better feel for how all this stuff works
by just making things in a DCC. I found [Blender For Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/book/technology/software/animation-software/blender/blender-for-dummies-4th-edition-281639/)
for $10 at a used bookstore. It turned out to do a good job of explaining how Blender is structured
and not just How to Make Stuff.
